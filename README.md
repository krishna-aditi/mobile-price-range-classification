## Mobile Price Range Classification

### [About the dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iabhishekofficial/mobile-price-classification):
A mobile phone, cell phone, cellphone, or hand phone, sometimes shortened to simply mobile, cell or just phone, is a portable telephone that can make and receive calls over a radio frequency link while the user is moving within a telephone service area. The first handheld mobile phone was demonstrated by John F. Mitchell and Martin Cooper of Motorola in 1973, using a handset weighing c. 2 kilograms (4.4 lbs). In 1979, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) launched the world's first cellular network in Japan. In 1983, the DynaTAC 8000x was the first commercially available handheld mobile phone. From 1983 to 2014, worldwide mobile phone subscriptions grew to over seven billionâ€”enough to provide one for every person on Earth. In first quarter of 2016, the top smartphone developers worldwide were Samsung, Apple, and Huawei, and smartphone sales represented 78 percent of total mobile phone sales. For feature phones (or "dumbphones") as of 2016, the largest were Samsung, Nokia, and Alcatel.

### Objective:
We aim to analyze mobile phone features with price range 0(low cost), 1(medium cost), 2(high cost) and 3(very high cost). We will implement different models to classify the price range for the mobile phones.

#### Models used for multiclass classification:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Gradient Boosting Classifier
- Support Vector Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
